# MageOS_ThemeOptimization module

This module provides theme-related features to improve the performance of your Magento store, including:

* Back/Forward Cache support for faster browser navigation
* Page transitions when navigating between pages on Magento
* Speculative preloading of internal links on hover

## Requirements

* Magento 2.4.5+ or equivalent version of Adobe Commerce, Adobe Commerce Cloud, or Mage-OS

## Installation details

To install the module, run the following commands in SSH, from the Magento root directory:

```bash
composer require mage-os/module-theme-optimization
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Configuration

The module provides settings in the Magento Admin Panel under: **Stores > Configuration > Advanced > System**

All values can be configured at Default, Website, and Store View scopes.

There is no configuration for the Page Transitions feature. When installed, page transitions are always enabled for all Magento themes (frontend and admin panel).

### Speculative Loading
* **Enable Speculation Rules** - Enables speculative loading to preload pages before links are clicked, making perceived load times faster. (Default: Yes)
* **Mode** - Choose between prefetch and prerender modes. (Default: prefetch)
  - Prefetch: Downloads resources in advance
  - Prerender: Fully renders pages in advance (faster but may affect analytics data)
* **Eagerness Level** - Controls how aggressively pages are preloaded. (Default: Moderate)
  - Conservative: Minimal preloading, only when very likely to be needed
  - Moderate: Balanced approach between performance and resource usage
  - Eager: Aggressive preloading for maximum user experience, at the cost of loading pages the user may never visit
* **Exclude URL Patterns** - URL patterns to never preload. One pattern per line. (Default: customer, login, logout, auth, cart, checkout, search, download, redirect, rewrite, store, productalert)
  - URL patterns are matched against the request URI. We recommend entering part or full route paths, like "customer" (to exclude all customer pages) or "customer/account/logout" (to specifically exclude logout).
* **Exclude File Extensions** - File extensions to never preload. (Default: pdf, zip)
* **Exclude Selectors** - CSS selectors for links to never preload. Enter one selector per line. (Default: .do-not-prerender)

### Back/Forward Cache

Note: bfcache availability may vary based on your Full Page Cache engine.

* **Enable Back/Forward Cache** - Enable back/forward cache to store pages in browser memory temporarily for faster navigation. (Default: Yes)
* **Update Mini Cart on User Interaction**
  - Yes: Mini cart updates only after user interaction when page is restored from cache (Default)
  - No: Mini cart updates immediately on page restore
  - Recommended "Yes" to maintain optimal Page Speed and Core Web Vitals scores
* **Auto Close Menu** - Automatically close open menus when page is restored from back/forward cache (for compatible themes). (Default: Yes)
* **Exclude URLs** - Optional configuration to exclude specific URL patterns from back/forward cache. Enter URL parts (substring), one per line. The extension automatically excludes non-cacheable URLs, so this is only needed for custom cached URLs that load private data via JavaScript.

#### If you use Varnish FPC

For the Back/Forward Cache feature to work with Varnish Full Page Cache, you must modify your VCL file's `vcl_deliver` subroutine by updating the existing Cache-Control header logic.

```vcl
sub vcl_deliver {
  # Find the existing line that sets Cache-Control, like:
  set resp.http.Cache-Control = "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0";
  
  # Replace it with:
  if (resp.http.Cache-Control ~ "public") {
      set resp.http.Cache-Control = "no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0";
  } else {
      set resp.http.Cache-Control = "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0";
  }
}
```

- This modification requires manual VCL file editing and Varnish service restart
- Test thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production
- Consider using [elgentos/magento2-varnish-extended](https://github.com/elgentos/magento2-varnish-extended) for a more complete enhanced Varnish configuration

#### If you use Fastly (including Adobe Commerce Cloud)

For Fastly CDN, you must create two custom VCL snippets through the Magento admin panel, as follows:

**Step 1: Access VCL Snippets**
1. Navigate to **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System**
2. Expand **Full Page Cache** > **Fastly Configuration** > **Custom VCL Snippets**
3. Click **Create Custom Snippet**

**Step 2: Configure Snippet 1**
- **Name**: `bfcache-preserve-public-private`
- **Type**: `fetch`
- **Priority**: `1`
- **VCL Content**:

```vcl
if (beresp.http.Cache-Control) {
    if (beresp.http.Cache-Control ~ "public") {
        set beresp.http.X-MageOS-Bfcache = "public";
    } else {
        set beresp.http.X-MageOS-Bfcache  = "private";
    }
}
```
Save the snippet  
Click **Create Custom Snippet** again

**Step 3: Configure Snippet 2**
- **Name**: `bfcache-remove-ccns`
- **Type**: `deliver`
- **Priority**: `100`
- **VCL Content**:

```vcl
if (fastly.ff.visits_this_service == 0 && req.restarts == 0) {
    if (resp.http.X-MageOS-Bfcache == "public") {
       set resp.http.Cache-Control = "no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0";
    }
}

unset resp.http.X-MageOS-Bfcache;
```
Save the snippet

**Step 4: Deploy**

Click **Upload VCL to Fastly**, and Activate the uploaded VCL
